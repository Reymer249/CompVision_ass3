The structure of the repository:

- junk_artifacts - old files, that are not needed anymore, but it is too pity to delete them
- metrics - the folder with the results of training. There is a folder for each model, containing the lists of accuracies and losses through training, saved as `.pkl` files.
  The data in `time_taken.pkl` was entered ("winged") manually from the logs (so the delta of error is +- 10 seconds). The data in `tets_acc.pkl` and `test_loss.pkl` is from the output of the last cell in `test.ipynb`
- plots - the folder with plots we used in the paper. They are generated by the `Plots.ipynb`
- `Plots.ipynb` - notebook to geenrate plots
- `assignment3_model{n}.py` - code to train the model {n}
- `jester-cv-labels.csv` - csv with labels
- `jester-v1-{train/validation}.csv` - the separation of the data (with labels) provided for the assignment
- `model_{n}.ipynb` - a notebook with all the essential information about the model. The notebook is not meant to be run, but rather for presentation purposes of the practical implementation matters. More detailed
  code you find in the assignment3_model{n}.py of the model.
- `split_train_val.py` - the code to split the dataset provided as we wish (7/1/1 for train/val/test) using `jester-v1-{train/validation}.csv`
- `{train/val/test}.csv` - train and val generated by `split_train_val.py`. `test.csv` is just a renamed version of `jester-v1-validation.csv`
- `test.ipynb` - notebook to test the models
- `train_model{n}.log` - log of the training
